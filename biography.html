            <h3>Background</h3>

            <p>My full name is Alyssa Hnubci Tong Her, with my middle name translated to "sunshine." I am 17 years old, Hmong-American,
            and go to Bay City Western High School. I am from Michigan. My father was always a gamer-even as a teenager-so he ended up
            sharing his joy of gaming with the entire family by buying us a PlayStation. We also had a family computer, which I would 
            kill some time by playing flash games or online rpg games. Most of the time I was playing video games or making forts in 
            the basement with my siblings as a kid. A lot of my imagination and passion now comes from that time.</p>
