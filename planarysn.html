            <h3>Idea</h3>

            <p>PLANARYSN is a video game series that I have been writing for several years. There are nine planned video games in
            this series. Most of them branch from each other to connect specific ideas, and in the end, they paint a picture together. 
            Each letter of this abbreviation stands for each stories' main character, with each character from a certain path.</p>

            <h4>(R)in from <i>Only Kings</i></h4>

            <details>
            <summary>More on the story . . .</summary>   
            <p>Rin, a boy with the ability to speak to ghosts, is raised with other children in a facility that takes care of abnormal 
            adolescents. Every child is promised a bright future of freedom and success, with permanent ties to the facility that 
            guarantee their support for each child; only thing is that's a misconstrued truth. Rin finally remembers everything that
            the facility has done to him after a broke college student manages to steal the facility's brainwashing technology. With 
            that realization, Rin rebels against a facility that plans to treat all the children like experiments and weapons.</p>

            <h4>(P)ierrette from <i>Neon Nights</i></h4>

            <details>
            <summary>More on the story . . .</summary>
            <p>Pierrette is a woman who has set her mind on world peace, which is why she is the secret director of a program
            setting doomsday bombs around the world. The influence and authority her parents carry in the current world is great
            enough to control every society. Any person would have died to be reborn as the priveleged child that Pierrette is.
            However, Pierrette comes to understand the world as a painful and disconnected ruin bearing millions of ruined lives. 
            To naturally cover for herself and her identity, Pierrette works as a skilled chef at a local diner during the day.</p>

            <h4>(N)ori from <i>From Smogtown</i></h4>

            <details>
            <summary>More on the story . . .</summary>
            <p>Nori thought of herself as a sailor as she drifted to nowhere for two years at sea. The air was always hot and smokey,
            which poisoned her lungs and the health of other survivors from the explosions of the International Travel Portals. She 
            hadn't met a single soul until-miraculously-her home made it to a shore. On a small piece of land, Nori was provided a
            home and place in a community. She would become a historical figure of the council of Smogtown and set a legacy of 
            world-wide healing.</p>

            <h4>(Y)una from <i>Dreamers' Union Phenomenon</i></h4>

            <details>
            <summary>More on the story . . .</summary>
            <p>Yuna slept through most of her summer while listening to music while Asahi played video games every single day. The 
            twins started their first year of senior high, neither being fully prepared for what would happen to them, and wanted
            only to get through another year of school just to meet summer again. When a series of circumstances occur
            between them and their schoolmates, a phenomenon takes place; it unifies their minds in sleep. The purpose of this
            phenomenon serves the Dreamers' Union, which is a program that encourages the happiness and imagination of children.
            The kids go on with their normal school lives in the day, but the mental struggles they face will need more than just
            sleep.</p>

            <h4>(A)mber from <i>Minimum Wage Purgatory</i></h4>

            <details>
            <summary>More on the story . . .</summary>
            <p>Amber is a new recruited fast food worker in her last year of high school. This is her first job and the workplace
            atmosphere seems great, but as time goes on, she realizes how different every coworker of hers is. On top of that, after 
            her first night shift, she and her other coworkers fall into a nightmare of demon customers trying to eat as much food as
            possible. After every night shift, they come out and torment the workers in their nightmares. So this question
            stands: Is there an escape to any of this?</p>

            <h4>(A)braham from <i>April Through May</i></h4>

            <details>
            <summary>More on the story . . .</summary>
            <p>Abraham, a young man who is held in his father's house due to an unknown sickness, attempts to escape the prison his
            father made for him. His father wants to make him inherit the family company once his passing comes, so he refuses to let
            his boy go anywhere else but his conferences. Still, in his own room, Abraham practices the art of sculpting in order to
            remember an old childhood friend from his home land. He makes it to a hospital for an urgent emergency, then runs off once
            no one sees him. Abraham, in advance, decides he will travel back to his home land with the help of some entity in his sleep.</p>

            <h4>(N)icholas from <i>Children of a Magic</i></h4>

            <details>
            <summary>More on the story . . .</summary>
            <p>Nicholas is a young magic user and a part of a party including Shin, Maria, and Scott. Together, they take on quests 
            and travel the world to gain themselves the title of the greatest party ever to exist. Even though they are a group with
            the same goal at heart, each of them carry different beliefs that clash. Their childhoods and their personalities begin
            to split them on different paths. In the end, the four of them are split in history to decide their own fates.</p>

            <h4>(L)enora from <i>Blood Stays a Fantasy</i></h4>

            <details>
            <summary>More on the story . . .</summary>
            <p>Lenora works as a servant of the Centerpiece Palace, in which she serves multiple royal families from different realms. 
            Her parents and cousin have grown sickly, and she feels it in herself that she is sick as well. Despite all the despair in
            her life, Lenora smiles every day because she cherishes the fact that life is full of pain and joy. Serving the royals isn't
            so bad when you realize that they're living beings just as you are. It also is quite fun when mysteries with deathly
            consequences seemingly appear once you get to know them more.</p>
            </details>

            <h4>(S)pring from <i>Dearest Written in Heavy Ink</i></h4>

            <details>
            <summary>More on the story . . .</summary>
            <p>Spring runs off with his siblings and several friends to search for a cure to his mother's curse. The young, talented
            magician planned on facing this adventure by himself but not a single loved one of his would let him venture every realm
            alone. The group follows a plan that was uncompleted by his younger self, with reoccuring visions completing the rest of 
            the plan caused by the discovery of all of the research he buried away. With several mercenaries being paid to capture
            and return the group, they realize that this adventure will require them to stay as strong as they can together (and
            that's difficult for a bunch of kids that don't know how to express their feelings).</p>

            <!-- This paragraph summarizes the plan of PLANARYSN. -->
            <h3>Plan</h3>

            <p>Each story follows different genres and themes as shown in the summaries.</p> 
                
            <ol>
                <li>Rin, Pierrette, and Nori themes: free will and creating societal change.</li>
                <li>Yuna, Amber, and Abraham themes: the unconscious mind and mental connections we create.</li>
                <li>Nicholas, Lenora, and Spring themes: mortality and the significance of the heart.</li>
            </ol>  

            <p>These stories will be told in video games publically available on a website specifically for PLANARYSN. Each game will
            have different graphics, game mechanics, and etc. If anything, these video games will be subject to experimentation to
            create a website full of games that are part of my game development journey. I don't expect everything about these games
            or this website to be perfect. What I want out of this is for people to enjoy it and for me to challenge myself to create
            experiences that I can be proud of.</p>
